# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project challenges Data Analytic students to clean up the way data is stored and to analyze the information based on multiple variables. In this example we were to analyze information regarding fundraising goals and visualize raw numbers into clean, readable charts.

### Purpose
The purpose of my analysis was to correlate success criteria for campaigns based on what time of year Theater campaigns were launched and to break down "successful" outcomes based on the the fund rasing goal.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
